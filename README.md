# Air Quality Monitoring NFT Project

## Objective
This project aims to measure air conditions in a given space and provide verifiable and immutable records of the data onto the blockchain as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These NFTs will serve as certificates of veracity for the air quality information. Additionally, a user-friendly interface will fetch and display real-time information from the sensors.

## Components
- **Sensor Setup**: Install sensors to measure various air quality parameters.
- **Data Collection**: Collect air quality data continuously from the sensors.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Develop smart contracts on a blockchain platform like Ethereum to handle NFT creation and management.
- **Minting NFTs**: Trigger the minting of NFTs representing snapshots of air conditions.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user interface for users to view and interact with real-time air quality information fetched from the sensors. This interface will also display the NFTs representing historical air quality snapshots.

## Workflow
1. Sensors measure air quality parameters.
2. Data is collected and processed.
3. When certain conditions are met, an NFT representing the air quality snapshot is minted.
4. The NFT is recorded onto the blockchain, serving as a certificate of veracity for the air quality information.
5. Users can view real-time air quality information through the user interface and interact with the historical air quality NFTs.
